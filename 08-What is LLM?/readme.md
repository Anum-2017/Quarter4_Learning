## 📘 What Is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a type of artificial intelligence trained on massive amounts of text data. It can understand, generate, and manipulate human language in a way that feels remarkably natural.

Popular LLMs include:
- **ChatGPT** by OpenAI
- **Gemini** by Google
- **Claude** by Anthropic

## ⚙️ How Do LLMs Work?

1. **Training**: LLMs are trained on billions of words from books, websites, and more.
2. **Prompt Input**: Users give a prompt (a question, command, etc.).
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts the most likely next word in a sentence.
4. **Output**: It generates a coherent and human-like response.
