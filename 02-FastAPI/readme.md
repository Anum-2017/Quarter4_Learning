# 📘 Introduction to FastAPI

**FastAPI** is a modern Python web framework for building APIs. It is fast, easy to use, and built on top of Starlette and Pydantic for web handling and data validation. FastAPI uses Python's type hints for automatic validation, serialization, and documentation generation, making it an ideal choice for creating efficient, high-performance RESTful APIs.

--- 

# ❓ What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a web framework that helps developers build APIs quickly. It leverages Python's type annotations to automatically handle data validation and generate documentation. Based on the ASGI specification, FastAPI is highly efficient, especially for asynchronous applications, and it auto-generates interactive API docs with tools like Swagger UI and ReDoc.

---

# 🌟 What is UV?

**UV** is a command-line tool that simplifies the setup of FastAPI projects. It automates tasks like creating project directories, setting up virtual environments, and installing dependencies, which helps speed up the development process.

You might choose UV because it:
- Saves time by automating project setup
- Ensures consistency across multiple projects
- Installs FastAPI and Uvicorn with minimal effort
- Supports PEP 582 for easier and more modern dependency management

It’s ideal for quickly getting started with FastAPI. However, if you require more control over your project structure and configuration, a manual setup might be more suitable.

---

# 🚀 Project Setup

Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment and get started with FastAPI.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check Python Version
Make sure Python is installed on your system:

```bash
python --version
```

## 📁 Step 2: Create Project Folder
Use uv to initialize and navigate to your project folder:

```bash
uv init fastdca-p1
cd fastdca-p1
```

## 🐍 Step 3: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 📦 Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install FastAPI and essential libraries:

```bash
uv add "fastapi[standard]"
```

This installs:

- `fastapi`: The web framework.
- `uvicorn`: The ASGI server to run the app.
- `httpx`: An HTTP client for testing FastAPI endpoints.

## 🧪 Step 5: Add Testing Tools
Install development dependencies for testing:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest pytest-asyncio
```

## 🚀 Run Server
Run the server with the following command in the terminal:

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

# 🌟 Key Features of FastAPI

- **Fast Performance:** FastAPI handles requests faster than many other frameworks, competing with Go and Node.js in speed.

- **Automatic Data Validation:** Uses Python type hints and Pydantic to ensure correct data input and output.

- **Auto API Documentation:** Instantly generates interactive documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.

- **Easy Syntax:** Clear, concise syntax using Python’s type hints, reducing the need for additional documentation.

- **Asynchronous Support:** Fully supports async/await for efficient, non-blocking APIs.

- **Security:** Built-in support for OAuth2, JWT, and other authentication mechanisms.

- **Extensibility:** Easy to customize and extend with middleware and third-party packages.

# 🧾 Conclusion

FastAPI is a powerful, easy-to-use framework perfect for creating high-performance, secure, and well-documented APIs. It is well-suited for developers looking to build APIs quickly with minimal overhead, especially for modern asynchronous web applications.
