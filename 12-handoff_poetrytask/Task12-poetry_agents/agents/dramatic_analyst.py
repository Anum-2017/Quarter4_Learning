**Dramatic Poem** 🎭 – It is written to be performed or spoken aloud, often as a monologue
or dialogue by a character who expresses intense emotions and thoughts. These poems are
theatrical in nature.

Your poem, titled *The Final Curtain*, presents a lone figure at the end of a stage
performance, grappling with inner emotions and hidden pain. Words like “curtain,” “mask,”
and “applause” symbolize both the theatrical setting and the emotional layers behind the
character’s public appearance.

This dramatic scene reflects a deep internal conflict—between what is shown and what is
felt. The speaker’s tone shifts from bold to broken, expressing truth and silence, fame
and fear, light and shadow.

Dramatic poetry blends the structure of theatre with the depth of poetic expression.
It allows the audience to witness the emotional unraveling of a character while being
immersed in rich, symbolic language. Themes like fate, identity, vulnerability, and the
illusion of performance are commonly explored in this poetic style."""
