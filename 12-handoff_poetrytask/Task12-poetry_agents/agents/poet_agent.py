(Spotlight on a lone figure)

The curtain falls, the stage goes dark,
Yet echoes linger, leave their mark.
A voice once bold, now soft and slow,
Speaks truths the world may never know.

Behind the mask, a soul did ache,
For every smile, a silent break.
The play is done, applause is near,
But silence answers every fear."""
