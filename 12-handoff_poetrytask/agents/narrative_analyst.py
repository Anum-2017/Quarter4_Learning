**Narrative Poem** 📖 – A narrative poem tells a story with a plot, characters, and often a moral or message.

In this poem, a soldier’s story is told with honor and sadness. The use of “once upon a hill”
and “a tale of glory” suggests a legend passed down through time.

Narrative poems often combine storytelling with poetic elements like rhyme and rhythm.
They transport the reader through events and emotions, like a short story in verse form."""
