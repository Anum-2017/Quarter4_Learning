**Lyric Poem** 🌸 – A lyric poem reflects the poet’s personal feelings and emotions. It often
has a musical rhythm and is meant to evoke an emotional response rather than tell a full story.

In this poem, the speaker observes nature—daffodils dancing in the breeze—and expresses
a sense of peace and beauty. The imagery of “lonely as a cloud” creates a soft, introspective tone.

Lyric poetry often relies on vivid language and emotional expression. It connects readers
to the poet’s internal world, making it deeply personal and relatable."""
