# OpenAI Agent SDK ‚Äî Build Intelligent Modular AI Agents

Welcome to the **OpenAI Agent SDK** ‚Äî a powerful toolkit designed for developers to build smart, reusable, and interactive AI agents. These agents go beyond simple chatbots by maintaining context, using tools, and collaborating with other agents or users to perform complex tasks.

## üöÄ What is the OpenAI Agent SDK?

The OpenAI Agent SDK enables the creation of modular AI agents that think, reason, and act autonomously. It‚Äôs built around structured Python classes with capabilities including:

- **Context management:** Keep track of multi-turn conversations effortlessly.
- **Tool integration:** Use APIs, databases, and code execution to perform real-world actions.
- **Custom instructions:** Define consistent agent behavior with system prompts.
- **Multi-agent collaboration:** Build systems where multiple agents work together to accomplish goals.

Think of agents as intelligent software components designed to act, react, and reason within larger workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|-------|
| **Agent** | Defines the agent‚Äôs personality, memory, tools, and behavior instructions. |
| **Runner** | Manages the agent‚Äôs execution lifecycle, handling input and output. |
| **Context** | A shared data structure maintaining conversation state and dynamic data. |
| **Tools** | External functions or APIs the agent can leverage to perform actions. |

These pieces work together to make agent development scalable, reusable, and easy to maintain.

## üî• Why Choose the OpenAI Agent SDK?

The SDK revolutionizes how developers build LLM-powered applications by offering:

- **Reusability:** Build agents as modular components reusable across different projects.
- **Composability:** Combine multiple agents to create collaborative workflows (e.g., planner + writer).
- **Custom Tools:** Empower agents with external API access for real-world utility.
- **Control & Transparency:** Explicitly manage prompts, memory, and behavior within code.

This is the foundation for the new ‚Äúagentic‚Äù AI era where intelligent systems operate autonomously and cohesively.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. Why is the `Agent` class a Python dataclass?

Using `@dataclass` allows agents to be declared cleanly and concisely with built-in support for:

- Easy initialization without boilerplate
- Clear, readable debug output
- Straightforward serialization (for configs or logs)
- Simple instantiation with default and optional values

This design enhances readability, predictability, and integration.

### 2. Why are system prompts stored in the `Agent` class as instructions, and why can they be callables?

System prompts define the agent‚Äôs core personality and role. Storing them as an attribute:

- Ties behavior directly to the agent‚Äôs configuration
- Allows versioning and testing of prompt changes
- Ensures instructions are always bundled with the agent‚Äôs identity and tools

Allowing prompts to be callables enables dynamic, context-aware instructions that adapt at runtime‚Äîperfect for agents needing flexible personalities.

### 3. Why is the user prompt passed as a parameter to `Runner.run()` (a `@classmethod`)?

User input varies at each execution, so it‚Äôs passed during runtime rather than stored on the agent.

Using a `@classmethod` for `Runner.run()`:

- Keeps execution stateless and simple
- Avoids unnecessary object instantiation
- Offers a clean, functional API for running agents
- Makes testing and scripting straightforward

### 4. What does the `Runner` class do?

The Runner acts as the execution engine, responsible for:

- Accepting user or agent inputs
- Combining input with memory, context, and tools
- Calling the LLM and processing responses
- Returning structured outputs

It orchestrates multi-agent workflows and manages asynchronous tool calls, providing flexibility and modularity.

### 5. What are generics (`Generic`) in Python and why use them for `TContext`?

Generics enable type-safe, reusable components that can handle different context types.

Using a generic `TContext` allows agents and runners to:

- Work with custom context data specific to their use case
- Benefit from type hints and autocomplete in IDEs
- Reduce bugs by enforcing consistent context structure

This keeps the SDK flexible and robust for production-grade applications.

## üí° Real-World Applications

The OpenAI Agent SDK can power various projects such as:

- **Business workflows:** Scheduling, reporting, and task management agents working together.
- **Educational platforms:** Agents that teach, quiz, and provide feedback interactively.
- **E-commerce bots:** Product recommendation, inventory checkers, and order trackers.
- **Web research:** Agents for browsing, summarizing, and managing citations.

---

## üì¶ Getting Started

```bash
pip install openai-agent-sdk
```

## Import and define your first agent:

```python

from openai_agent_sdk import Agent, Runner

class MyAgent(Agent):
    name = "Helpful Assistant"
    instructions = "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions clearly."

# Run the agent
response = Runner.run(MyAgent, "What is the weather today?")
print(response)
```

## ‚ú® Summary
The OpenAI Agent SDK marks a shift in AI development ‚Äî from one-off prompts to intelligent, modular agents with memory, tools, and collaboration. Whether you're building a single agent or a multi-agent system, this SDK equips you with the architecture and power to create truly agentic applications.
